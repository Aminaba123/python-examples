Python Projects
============

Some of my Python snippets, usually trying out different libraries.

**beautifulsoup** - Using bs4, does web scraping (get a website in HTML, pull out specific data in a clean format)

**bookrecommend** - A hacked together book recommendation engine using Python and R (getting used to formatting and manipulating data with dataframes)

**datascience_ga** - Data Science/Machine Learning Course that I completed at General Assembly NYC; goes over regressions, random forests, naive bayes, k means, dimension reduction, ensemble methods with a lot of scikit learn

**django** - The Django introductory Polls tutorial and Tango with Rango tutorial

**doctest** - Creating tests for Python code using doctest

**etl** - An Extraction, Transformation, Loading system for a web system (input a csv file, clean data, write to a SQL Server Database)

**fabric** - Streamlining SSH to automate tasks (application deployment to system administration tasks) for nginx and gunicorn on Ubuntu

**faker** - Generate mass fake data/records (e.g. dates, names)

**ggplot** - R's ggplot2 for plotting (Note: the library seems very rough still, much easier to just switch to R)

**googleappengine** - hello world and guestbook examples using Google's App Engine backend

**hashlib_and_hmac** - A quick and dirty way of obfuscating data

**l2h** - basic data transformations in Excel files and scraping web stats

**mechanize** - web scraping using mechanize

**mock** - Creating mock objects for unit testing

**mongodb_class** - MongoDB's intro class for working with MongoDB for Python Developers

**nltk** - Library for Natural Learning Tool Kit / Machine Learning (mainly text); e.g. count words, lexical diversity of Game of Thrones books

**pandas** - How to reorganize and do data analysis (e.g. use DataFrames)

**pickle** - How to serialize and deserialize a Python object (aka serialization, marshalling, flattening)

**projecteuler** - Math and programming questions from projecteuler.net

**pythonbasics** - Random stuff I forget about the Python basics (e.g. decorators, classes)

**pytesseract** - Uses the Python Image Library (PIL), takes an image, and tries to return text

**pytest** - Creating tests for Python code using pytest

**requests** - Using Python's standard library to make requests

**regex** - Doing Regular Expressions in Python

**robotgame** - Create the AI for robots to battle one another on robotgame.net

**sqlalchemy** - An Object Relational Mapper for connecting Python to databases through code

**tkinter** - Create GUIs for the desktop with Python

**xkcd** - Plotting with matplotlib, but with the xkcd look

**yahtzee** - Just making dice roles
